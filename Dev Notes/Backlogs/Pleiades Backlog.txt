Pleiades Administrative Area - TODO
===================================


URGENT ==> ** Fix the latest wierd MVC bug on Edit with empty first name **


A DREAM VISION...
=================
1.) I have groups of reusable Service, Repository, and Provider objects
2.) I create a light-weight, simple Controller class each Action which corresponds to a View
3.) While creating my Views, I link to CSS and JS files using object methods
4.) Creating links and actions is... brainlessly easy, entirely OO'ed
5.) Adding controls, 

** ALSO: an Auto Model Trim thingy ** - wire it into ASP.NET MVC
** HOW ABOUT: strongly typed Redirects?  Yeah man! **


SPECIAL CRITIQUE - THE AJAX FAIL WORLD
======================================
- Large amounts of repetition in the Ajax Grid
- Coupling of ASP.NET MVC Controllers and Views to the AJAX front end... pretty poor design IMO
- BUT WAIT: there are AJAX methods mixed into the Controller
- BUT WAIT: now MVC Views (which can function dynamically i.e. without compiler safety) can FAIL and bring us down
- No real, systematic error handling for JQuery failures
- Horrifically slow
- Too many implementation details... should be some way to query my service to get standard methods... not unlike COM
- No real state management - state is implied
- Debugging these Javascript issues - no call stack, no breakpoint, how to improve?

CURRENT WOES/PAINPOINTS
=======================
- MVC Postback Controls: how to make building controls terse, yet injectible and reusable
=> Some way to use the extension methods, but leverage the DI container, somehow
=> Some way to get the CSS as an embedded resource
=> Some way to make the CSS names sub-class-able...?

- MEGA: coupling of views to hard-coded CSS structures... how do decouple CSS...?
- MASSIVE: the must be some way to greatly increase the OOP usage of Routelink and Actionlink's so that it's strongly typed i.e. MakeGotoAdminPageLink()
- BIG: Master Page brings the CSS style sheets, and yet content pages can't control this...???
- Organization of CSS file - no real convention, feels ad-hoc.  Same issue with locating scripts and images.  Lacks overall reusability
- Image mouse over fail on login page - no pre-load
- With MVC in general - not entirely clear on the validation best practices.  Would prefer to have Domain Objects managing validation, and have MVC be a dumb terminal
- STill not comfortable with Routelinks, Actionlinks, etc.
- Arent Scripts technically content?
- Lack of symmetry with the Admin Area and the default Area
- Don't know how the various web.config files in sub-directories come into play
- How safe, secure is Github?  Disaster recovery?  Mirrored?

* Move the Public stuff into its own Area
* Package the Navigation Menu in its own View
* Start using IIS for development

Productivity Concerns
---------------------
0.) Need to upgrade CSS knowledge base - badly!
1.) Learn how to user AutoMapper - it's powerful
2.) Design interfaces, first!
3.) Get Adobe Photoshop...?
4.) HTML 5...?
5.) TODO: get a proper LINQ Book, son.


A Wee-Bit About View
--------------------
<% Html.RenderAction(...) %> ==> Uses Model Binding with a Partial View
<% Html.RenderPartial(...) %> ==> Pass Model explicitly
<% Html.Action(...) %> ==> returns a string

FUCKING COOL!
