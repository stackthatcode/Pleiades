Life Story of a File Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.1.) User uploads File Resource
1.2.) File is processors and stored in the Resource Storage
1.3.) Controller returns External Resource Id
2.) ???
3.1.) User saves a record which references the  External Resource Id
3.2.) Repository gets the image Id by ERId
3.3.) Reposttory saves the Brand/Color/Product Record, with the Resource associated to the parent record


Clean-up Process
----------------
* Can be run periodically
* Can be run against blocks of 100x Records
* Can be triggered with each Upload based on orphans with a certain lifespan (30 minutes or more...)

1.) Remove all Files which have IsDeleted == true
2.) Remove all Files which are not linked to anything





Image Service Concerns - SAVE FOR LATER
---------------------------------------
- How do we store multiple sizes of same image?  How do we reference them?  How do we discover the reference?
- How do we create the different sizes?
- What happens to the original?
- How do images store their authorization?  How do we cache images?
- When we save an image in the ImageRepository, does it issue the new file name for us?
- Where do we place the physical storage...?
- How do we reuse the Image object across difference Domain objects...?
