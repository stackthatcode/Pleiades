Forward Commerce
----------------
* http://getfwd.com/ -- scary, inspiring, and impressive.  Very nice.  Tip my hat to these folks!
* Getting down to business, their Categories Editor is not all that impressive.  Noticed that they're struggling with hierarchical management of categories
* I love the color scheme and UI.  It's well done.
* They have the concept of BUNDLE ITEM - good idea.
* I can see that they may be struggling with the inline editing of categories and so forth.
