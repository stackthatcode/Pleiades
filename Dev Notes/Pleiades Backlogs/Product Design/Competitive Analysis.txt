COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forward Commerce
----------------
* http://getfwd.com/ -- scary, inspiring, and impressive.  Very nice.  Tip my hat to these folks!
* Getting down to business, their Categories Editor is not all that impressive.  Noticed that they're struggling with hierarchical management of categories
* I love the color scheme and UI.  It's well done.
* They have the concept of BUNDLE ITEM - good idea.
* I can see that they may be struggling with the inline editing of categories and so forth.

MMA Warehouse
-------------
* http://www.mmawarehouse.com/ => Easily the best MMA online store, so far
* On further inspection, the taxonomy is actually kind of wierd, especially the left-side browsing stuff...
* INTERESTING: there are multiple bread crumb paths to products
* DRAWBACK - can't browse by brand

Others
------
- http://www.fightersmarket.com => Volusion site - pretty nice
- http://www.riofightwear.com/ => Another Volusion site - done poorly
