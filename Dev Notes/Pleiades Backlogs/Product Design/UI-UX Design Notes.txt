DESIGN QUESTIONS

20121006 Table Design Pow Wow
-----------------------------
- Aleks: craftsman's pride
- Maria Says: it's cumbersome 
- Maria Says: why do you want it all on one page -- it's too busy
- Maria Says: take me to the page where it's just Jeans, or just Jackets
- Maria Says: benefit == ability all sub-categories
- Aleks: can't see all top-level categories - that's something you'd want to see

=> POINT - don't assume a Product can't belong to multiple Categories and/or Sub-Categories

Stuff That's Good and Works about Fwd-Commerce
----------------------------------------------
- Can browse all Categories and Sub-Categories WHILE Editing a Category or a Sub-Category
- Can browse by a single action -- dragging a scrollbar
- One click on a BIG GRID brings up the editor - easy and probably works well on tablets
- The "Tabbed" browsing inside of Categories.  Nice, clear representation state with other opportunities
- Moreover - it remembers the state as you click through the grid.  E.g.: now I'm browsing the Products that belong to each Category
- Can change the parent of a Category at will
- Can edit ANY entry in the entire hierarchy - and within one click!
- The AJAX hour glass on the background is subtle and cool
- Listing the number of Products under a Category is *good*, and the date Last Updated is OK
- Search Category field is OK
- Maybe forcing *everything* to be a Sub Category isn't a bad idea...
- The light on dark background works pretty well
- Selecting a Category is clean...
- There is a clean division between searching and editing...

Stuff That's Not so Good and doesn't Works about Fwd-Commerce
-------------------------------------------------------------
- Can't see all top-level Categories
- Possibly too much scrolling... and for what?  What User Story is there for scrolling?  To search: scroll and scroll.
- The right side Editor is small... that could present difficulties
- Any state change -- Add New, Update, Delete, Move to new Parent needs to be reflected on the right
- It is possible to get lost and say "hey, what am I doing, again...?"
- Will only work on small lists (20 - 40)
- While I'm Editing a Category, if I scroll through the list, I lose the place of the Category I'm currently editing.  "Where's the next sub-category, again?"
- Matching the left-side state to whatever I'm editing could be tricky when adding a new Category 
- The Delete icon is not completely easy to find.
- Adding Images to Categories... isn't this coupling content to data...?
- Too much random access... it would be preferable to narrow focus to one specific area
- Maria calls it cumbersome, too much on one page
- Seem fixated on the "one-page site design"



TOOLING STRATEGY
----------------
- Q4 2012 thru Q1 2013 => Continue to use GIMP and Inkscape to get Storefront rolling
- Q2 2013 => Purchase Adobe Photoshop and invest time in learning to use the tool

Notes on Aesthetics
-------------------
- The Admin UI colors => charcol, blue, black and white

ACTION ITEMS
------------
- Start building mock-up of the only Store Front =>  TODO
