Editor Post Mortem Notes------------------------- Trees are nice to look at, but they're not fun to modify.- SoC is always important and true.  If it still seems too complicated, the problem hasn't been properly defined, with individual issues identified and organized.- Sometimes, minimizing properties is important.  IOW don't have too many properties to express your view state.- Every new library carries a learning curve.  Don't expect changes to architecture to be immediately obvious.  ALSO: trying to accomplish basic things will require a large amount of time if you haven't already done it.- Without Unit Testing you're making unrealistic expectations -- and about to waste your time.Remaining Steps Forward------------------------1.)
