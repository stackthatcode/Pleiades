If it still seems too complicated, the problem hasn't been properly defined, with individual issues identified and organized.- Sometimes, minimizing properties is important.  IOW don't have too many properties to express your view state.- Every new library carries a learning curve.  Don't expect changes to architecture to be immediately obvious.  ALSO: trying to accomplish basic things will require a large amount of time if you haven't already done it.- Without Unit Testing you're making unrealistic expectations -- and about to waste your time.UPDATE:- When we're going to have client-side state persist between server refreshes, that state needs to be stored separately i.e. in a dictionary or something(!!!)- Without understanding HOW a framework operates, you can expect surprises along the way.  You need to understand the fundamental architecture of your supporting frameworks, otherwise, your estimate are at the mercy of fortune.PENDING FEATURE BACKLOG------------------------ Review order of Modal Ok/Cancel => PENDING EVAL- Show the number of Products under Category => PENDING EVAL- Modify Category Editor design i.e. Number of Categories, Products, etc. => PENDING EVAL- Rendering Adjustments for long Category Names et. al. => PENDING EVAL- TASK => cross-browser test Animation Stuff, mayhaps introduce method chaining => PENDING EVAL- Add Modal Pop-up - "Are You Sure?"
