Editor Post Mortem Notes------------------------- Trees are nice to look at, but they're not fun to modify.- SoC is always important and true.  If it still seems too complicated, the problem hasn't been properly defined, with individual issues identified and organized.- Sometimes, minimizing properties is important.  IOW don't have too many properties to express your view state.- Every new library carries a learning curve.  Don't expect changes to architecture to be immediately obvious.  ALSO: trying to accomplish basic things will require a large amount of time if you haven't already done it.- Without Unit Testing you're making unrealistic expectations -- and about to waste your time.Some Burndown-------------Front Range - 11/4/2012 - RECAP- Good to create a solid DataAdapter mock - CHECK- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6237198/jquery-show-div-and-scroll-to-it-without-hashtag-in-url- Possibly create a separate Adapter class...  which can be mocked up so I can test my AJAX stuff separately => TODO-1.)
