Editor Post Mortem Notes------------------------- Trees are nice to look at, but they're not fun to modify.- SoC is always important and true.- Sometimes, minimizing properties is important- If it still seems too complicated, the problem hasn't been properly defined, with individual issues identified and organized.- Every new library carries a learning curve.  Don't expect changes to architecture to be immediately obvious.- Without Unit Testing you're making unrealistic expectations -- and about to waste your time.Remaining Steps Forward-----------------------0.)
