Order Submission Flow - Bound Contexts and Concerns
---------------------------------------------------
- Product Context (Creation, Deletion of Product, Colors, Images)
- Inventory Context (In-stock, Reserved & Available Quantities)
- Order Context (Creation of Order, Tracking/Management of Order Status)
- Payment Context (Payment Processing, Receipt/record of Payment, Refunds, Payment History by canonicalized-email or User ID)
- Communication Context (Email, Email Send History, Faxes, etc.)
- Analytics Context (Sale Record, Product Popularity, Refund Record)

ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW 1/24/2013
------------------------------
- Flatten the Membership Provider object graph stuff
- Copy from the Dot Net Framework into MembershipService
- Create a separate Authentication Service - Aggregate User Service should deal with CRUD only
- Owner Authorization Service overlaps with Aggregate User Services... eliminate this method Authorize(int ownerUserId)
- Determine how to delegate User Authorization to Aggregate User Service... if at all!  Maybe that shit goes in the Controller?  Hmm....
- Consider using OnActionExecuting instead of the Attribute... maybe.
- Ultimately, should Pleiades be separate from Commerce...?  Nah, but move that Attribute out of Pleiades.  Fuck Security Context factory.
- Move Owner Auth Service under Rules
- Roll Pleiades.UnitTests and Security Tests into Pleiades.Web.UnitTests
- Roll Pleiades Base, Data EF, and TestHelpers into Pleiades.Web.Foundation
- Move ProductSearchRepository stuff into the Controller.  Yup!  Try it!
- Compbine Domain and Persist assemblies.  They're not separate, dude!!!
* NOTE: we never ever DELETE User records
