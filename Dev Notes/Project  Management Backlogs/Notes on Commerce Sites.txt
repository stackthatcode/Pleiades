GENERAL FLOW
============

- No mouseover images for buttons - other than CSS properties.  PERIOD.  No reason to solve that problem.
- TODO: review JQuery metro skin

- Engage with the Customer via a survey ala http://www.cannonsafe.com/survey/
- Nice: padding:5px on select fields 

- STRATEGY: vacuum the content off of fightshop.com and use it as proxies

- How best to manage Admin Navigation?
- What is the most expedient way to enable Admin browsing of Products?
- How can colors, and features of the object be managed...?  What does that back-end look like?
- Can we manually edit Navigation Links?  Or, are they configured with the IoC container?
