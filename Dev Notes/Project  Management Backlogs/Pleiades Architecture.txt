Summary of Pleiades.Web.Security Division of Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IdentityService
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Independent logic for managing User Roles and Ownership Authorization

MembershipService 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Wrapper around Microsoft MembershipProvider

AggregateService
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- aggregates User creation across Identity and Membership boundaries
- overlaps MembershipRepository, due to DbContext isolation 

OUTSTANDING ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Because Membership service can't participate in Transactions, need belt and suspends for creating AggregateUsers... => THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM


Retrospective on Security Framework
-----------------------------------
- Bugged by the fact the Identity is purely pluggable, since it makes assumptions about the Domain.  This seems like an argument for moving it into Pleiades.Web and calling the Pleiades.Web.Security.Patina.

* Could converge Identity with the Aggregate Services... as this is more "honest".  Thus, the overlapping Repository concerns are managed by the AggregateRepository.

* AggregateUser is already coupled to Identity ==> plus Identity is not swappable.
