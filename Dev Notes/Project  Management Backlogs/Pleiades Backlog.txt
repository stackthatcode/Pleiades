DESIGN & TECH BACKLOG - REVIEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- EntityFramework - how to perform basic CRUD stuff - Damn Brutha! => TODO
- EntityFramework Transactions and ASP.NET MVC Concurrency
- Start adding Logging stuff - you won't be sorry! => TODO
- Easily the most important security article evar => - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rickandy/archive/2011/05/02/securing-your-asp-net-mvc-3-application.aspx
- Look up Troy Hunt's article's, too



THOUGHTS:
---------
1.) FormLineEditor's are for rapidly building interfaces.
2.) We need: Input Control rendering, Model Binding stuff for Postback, and rendering Validation
3.) DESIRE => Composable Control Builders
* Can add stuff to the Control that injects Style
* Can add stuff to the Control that adds Validation Feedback

4.) Why do we need to compose Labels with the Editor itself...?  What's the honest trade-off?
* Add stuff to the Label itself for Validation Feedback

5.) Try using Facebook without JavaScript

STUFF TO CONFIGURE/BUILD
------------------------
=> Location of CSS Files Directory
=> Location of JavaScript Directory
=> Location of Control Dependent Images and CSS and JS Files
=> Method:

SomethingLibrary.SetDependenciesLocation()
SomethingLibrary.InjectControlDependencies()

Technical Debt #1 - how does the CSS file and JavaScript know how to render the file paths...?
