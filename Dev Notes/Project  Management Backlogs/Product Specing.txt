ALL ABOUT PRODUCTS
==================
- Can a Product belong to more than one Category?  It appears that Fight Shop supports multiple categories... (FOLLOW-UP: no, it does not)
- Are Categories a Taxonomy?  I think that they are.  How to make Taxonomies searchable?
- How do major things like Color influence the search?  How are Colors abstracted?
- What happens when two items are next to each other and don't possess the same searchable traits?  Context?  Or this too abstract?

=========
- IDEA! => decouple Product object from Searchable traits
* Save the Product
* Create the Searchable Index
- PROBLEM => how to create Taxonomic Menus, etc. without coupling to database...?  How to enforce RI...?
- EGADS!  Why is our thinking about Data Problems so deeply confined to SQL...?
- There are multiple Taxonomies, multiple Searches
- Searches and Taxonomies may just be forms of Searches
- TRUTH ABOUT SEARCH => OR searches are a "fail" in e-commerce.
- SQL works very well for storing normalized data, but not much else => I wish I could work on stuff in memory
- ARCHITECTURE => no reason why Search and Product storage could not be 100% decoupled from each other - SOA
- ORDERING is applied directly to Tags
- PROGRAMMING EASE => why not do all Searching, Filtering, and Ordering directly on the product cache...?
- Is there a way to categorize Tags...?
- How can navigation Menus get crafted to reflect current browsing state...?  How can current browing state be abstract...?

OK: Taxonomies are independent of Tags


Searching for Products
======================
- Admins need to find Products
- Customers need to find Products
- Create 1 to N Taxonomies for both to search


Into the Cache
==============
- 1 to N Product References => 1 to N Tags


Abstract Search Algorithm
=========================
- Identify current Resultset
- Apply Filter to Resultset
- Repeat until Filters are complete

=> EDGECASE: the First Filter will hit every row / every other Filter will only hit stuff that was returned from First Filter


Search Case #1 - Taxonomy 
=========================
INPUT: Mens > Shirts > Polo > Izod
- Exact Create UTN Result Mens => store in Resultset
- Exact Filter UTN Shirts => prune Resultset
- Exact Filter UTN Polos => prune Resultset
- Exact Filter UTN Izod => prune Resultset

Search Case #2 - Keyword Search
===============================



=> QUESTION: how to 
=> 


Tag Object
==========
- UniversalTagName  e.g.: Shirts
- List<string> ExactMatchName e.g.: Shirts
- List<string> Mispellings e.g.: Shurt, sirts




Tag Serialization Process
=========================
0.) SKU Number => SKU Tag
1.) Product Name => Product Name Tag
2.) Brand => Brand Tag
3.) Category/Keyword Tags => 1 to N Category/Keyword Tags



Sample Taxonomies
=================
- Motorcycle Accessories => Protective Gear => Men's =>  Helmets
- Motorcycle Accessories => Protective Gear => Women's =>  Helmets
- Boys => Jeans
- Girls => Jeans


Taxonomies, Search, etc.
========================
- Filtering by Guys & Girls should affect *every* search => thus browsing by Taxonomy makes a lot of sense
- Size and Color are optional - they will affect the User's interaction - both Admin and Customer
- AHA! - is it really a Taxonomy, or can the tags be weighted?  IOW, is a Taxonomy something that exists *apart* from the product?  A Taxonomy is a type of a Search!!!


Editing a Taxonomy
==================
- Add a new Taxonomy
- Rename a Taxonomy
- View Products Assigned to Taxonomy
- Move a Taxonomy



Searchable Abstract Objects Types
=================================
- Keyword Tags
- Brand - optional (what if it's a single-branded website)
- Size - optional
- Color - optional


Search Precedence Proposal
==========================
0.) SKU Number
1.) Product Name
2.) Brand
2.) Category Tags
3.) Keyword Tags
4.) Description

Search Algorithm Pseudocode
===========================
1.) In order of Precedences, accumulate Hits, and attach a Score
2.) Order By Hit Score
3.) Remove Duplicates
4.) ???
5.) Profit
