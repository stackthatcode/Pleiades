----------------------------------------------------

1.) http://www.micrositemasters.com/features.php
- Clean and soft, nicely organized
- Subtle cues imbues it with 3D quality e.g.: button highlights & shadows
- Could use a little more contrast, appears a bit washed out

2.) http://www.micrositemasters.com/pricing.php are 
- Cartoonish Checkmarks are strangely effective
- The line break in the columns is sloppy, and the serif-ed font is not happening
- The text block is artificially constrained

3.) http://www.micrositemasters.com/login.php
- Look amateurish
- Bottom banner - why 3D?
- Gradient madness - Elance Designer Disease
- Wierd alignment issues, looks hastily planned

-----------------------------------------------

1.) Header
- Bold, awesome header, wonderful blue and white contrast
- Comments in the upper right: elegant fade in of the quotes AND nice subtle difference in text color
- Nice shade of blue with the "MetroTwit for Desktop" mouse over
- "Learn More" text nicely complements

- BUT: why not make "MetroTwit" float left with the "T"?)
- ALSO: switching between center and left alignment.
- DOWN ARROW: floating in outerspace.
- BIGGEST COMPLAINT: seems like a lot of space was wasted, and elements may float in outer space a bit too much.  Nothing anchors things.
=> How to fix? Use Proximity or Repetition!

2.) Menu Bar
- Perfect font, great contrast, nice mouse over highlight

- WHY: the blue	difference?  Either use the same blue, or pad the top... otherwise looks a little wierdish
- STATE: doesn't mean much with this page if you scroll...

3.) MetroTwit for Desktop - Top Area
- LOVE the large font typeface and contrast smaller text
- The Green complements the Blue nicely

- SPACE: again, there's a little bit much space, but this is mitigated by the line

4.) MetroTwit for Desktop - Tri-Columns
- Awesome repetition, like the secondary heading
- Beautiful Blue and White Buttons and nice MetroTwit show "widget"

- BUT: how in the hell would the User find them?
- ALSO: the text which spans two columns is disruptive... oh, well

5.) http://www.metrotwit.com/show/
- Nice angle on the screen
- Nice transition from Bold to Non-Bold Heading
- Pretty well-balanced

- SPACE: slight issues with space, but pardonable
- The break from white to black is abrupt.

6.) MetroTwit for Windows8
- Well-balanced, nice contract, nice blue, nice shadow
- BUT: the green and blue don't mesh together
