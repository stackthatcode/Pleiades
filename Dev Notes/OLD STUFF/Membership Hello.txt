Requirements
============

1.) Guarantee that whatever extended, domain-specific functionality is added to Membership Provider is treated atomically

2.) An obvious performance snafu; 

- Request arrives on page 
- Forms Authentication ticket is extracted
- User name is validated in Membership (1 SQL Call)
- User roles are queried (1 SQL Call)
- (option) User domain stuff is queried (1 SQL Call)

==> If this happens 10 times, there are 30 calls against data.
==> Encountered this scenario with BlazeBroker
==> This is an argument for the Unified User concept -- or at least being able to make a solitary call for authentication details

REBUTTAL: Unified User is valuable, but a Repository which can be connected to a centrally-accessible cache may


3.) Want to keep super-skinny controllers; don't want heavy-weight logic -- which will lead to Repeating Oneself

4.) DO WANT: to take advantage of the password encryption faculties of the Membership Provider, and the interface that's evolved for that.

5.) Worried about: replicating the User's object properties -- seems redundant.

==> SOLUTION: use Automapper to move properties around
==> Think of the Membership Provider as a 

6.) ADMISSION: I was wrong to harshly judge the Membership Starter Kit ==> the guy that designed it definitely saw some real issues.

8.) Is the Role Providere THAT BAD????  

9.) DO NOT NEED: to have the MembershipUser
