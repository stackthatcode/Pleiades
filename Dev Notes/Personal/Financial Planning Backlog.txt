QUESTION: is it safe being motivated by fear?  Is there a better way?

Woke up freaked out about retirement!  Lots of fear and embarassment over not having more money saved.  "They're better than me, I'm stupid.  Even with my high-faluting degree, I should be way better off.  Why did I waste all that money with Michael and his stupid enterprise?  Then working as an affiliate?  Will people hire me when I'm older?  I'll look stupid working with all that grey hair.  I'll be working with a bunch of old men in a horrible, political insurance company... etc. etc."

OBSERVATION: age discrimination is real. Also, every year companies start to care less and less about employees (and vice versa).
