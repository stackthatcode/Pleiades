Admin Notification: A System Error has occurred - 2f6ae16c-92c6-423b-8000-c6e69462dbfd

System.InvalidOperationException:Multiple types were found that match the controller named 'System'. This can happen if the route that services this request ('system/{action}') does not specify namespaces to search for a controller that matches the request. If this is the case, register this route by calling an overload of the 'MapRoute' method that takes a 'namespaces' parameter.

The request for 'System' has found the following matching controllers:
