Admin Notification: A System Error has occurred - 5c033610-44a8-4613-aec7-7439c7b71c1c

System.InvalidOperationException:Multiple types were found that match the controller named 'System'. This can happen if the route that services this request ('system/{action}') does not specify namespaces to search for a controller that matches the request. If this is the case, register this route by calling an overload of the 'MapRoute' method that takes a 'namespaces' parameter.

The request for 'System' has found the following matching controllers:
